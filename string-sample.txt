Here are this week's five freeCodeCamp resources that are worth your time:

1. Learn Backend development by coding 3 full-stack projects with Python. Prolific freeCodeCamp teacher Tomi Tokko will take you step-by-step through building: an AI blog tool, a functional clone of Netflix, and a Spotify-like music platform. You'll learn how to use the powerful Django webdev framework, along with PostgreSQL databases and Tailwind CSS. This course is a big undertaking. But Tomi makes it enjoyable and accessible for beginners. If you can put in the time to complete this, you'll gain experience with an entire stack of relevant tools.

2. Jabrils is an experienced game developer who makes hilarious videos about his projects. He's also taught a popular programming course on freeCodeCamp. I interviewed him on this week's freeCodeCamp podcast about AI, anime, and his new turn-based fighting game.

3. Learn how to turn your Figma designs into working code. Ania Kubów is one of freeCodeCamp's most beloved teachers. And in this course, she showcases the power of generative AI. She'll walk you through taking a Figma design of an Airbnb-style website and converting it into a fully-functional app. She'll also show you how to add authentication and deploy it to the cloud.

4. GitHub recently launched 4 professional certifications. And this comprehensive guide will help you prepare to pass first of these – the GitHub Foundations exam. Chris Williams has used Git extensively over the decades while working as a software engineer and cloud architect. He breaks down key Git concepts and makes them much easier to learn.

5. And speaking of Git, if you have Spanish-speaking friends, tell them that freeCodeCamp just published a new Spanish-language Git course. It covers basic version control concepts like repositories, commits, and branches. And it even teaches you more advanced techniques like cherry picking.

The freeCodeCamp community is hard at work building new learning resources in so many world languages. Korean. Swahili. Ukrainian. Help us make learning to code easier for people who speak your ancestral language as well. You can support our charity's mission directly: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate

Quote of the Week: “If you don't follow your curiosity, you won't end up where you deserve to be.” — Jabrils on his journey into coding and gamedev, on this week's freeCodeCamp Podcast

Until next week, happy coding.
